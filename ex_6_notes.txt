SAMPLE INPUT:
What is your current age? 17
At what age would you like to retire? 60

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
You have 43 years left until you can retire.
It's 2025, so you can retire in 2068  

STEPS TO WRITE THE CODE:
1. we can import datetime module to get the current year or we can just assign current_year = 2025 as both will work properly
2. get the year from the module and store as current_year
3. prompt the user for current age and store it as current_age
4. prompt the user for retirement age and store it as retirement_age
5. display the number of years left for retirement by subtracting retirement_age - current_age
6. display in which year the user will be retired by adding current year and the number of years left for retirement
