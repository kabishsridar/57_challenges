STEPS TO WRITE THE CODE:
1. import math module to round off the integer
2. prompt the user for order_amount, state
3. initiate tax rate as 0.055 and tax as 0
4. subtotal is the order amount normally, so assigned subtotal = order_amount
5. if the input is WI then it should calculate the tax and subtotal according to that
6. if the input is WI, then it should return the subtotal, tax, total. else it should retun only the total
