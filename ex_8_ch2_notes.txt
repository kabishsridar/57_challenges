Enter number of pieces each person wants: 3
Enter number of slices per pizza: 8

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
8 people want 3 slice(s) each.
You need to buy 3 pizza(s).

STEPS TO WRITE THE CODE:
1. import math module to perform ceil function
2. prompt the user for number of people, slices_per_person, slices_per_pizza and store it
3. define a function isinteger to check whether it is a digit using .isdigit() function
4. if the inputs are a valid digits, then convert them to integer
5. total_slices_needed = people * slices_per_person will be the slices needed for all people
6. Use the math.ceil() function to round up the number of pizzas needed, ensuring everyone gets their desired slices.  
7. displays how many slices we need
8. displays how many pizzas we need
