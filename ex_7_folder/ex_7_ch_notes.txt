SAMPLE INPUT:
What is the length of the room in feet? 20
What is the width of the room in feet? 18
You entered dimensions of 20 feet by 18 feet.
Choose between Feet or Meters to display the output: meters

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
33.4450944 square meters

STEPS TO WRITE THE CODE:
1. Initialize unit as an empty string to store the user's selected unit.  
2. Define the choose_unit() function to prompt the user to choose between feet or meters. If the input matches valid meter options, set unit = "Square meters". If it matches valid feet options, set unit = "Square feet".  
3. Define the isinteger(a) function to check if the input contains only digits using .isdigit(). If true, return True. If false, print "Only integers accepted" and return False.  
4. Prompt the user to enter the length and width in feet. Display the entered dimensions.  
5. Convert room_length and room_width to integers using int() for calculations.  
6. Calculate area in square feet using area_in_feet = width * length. Convert to square meters using area_in_metre_sq = area_in_feet * 0.09290304.  
7. Validate that both room_length and room_width are integers using isinteger(). If valid, proceed with unit selection and area calculation.  
8. Display the final area based on the selected unit using:
