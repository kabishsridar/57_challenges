SAMPLE INPUT:
Enter the room(L-shaped, round, rectangle): round
Enter the radius of ceiling(sq feet): 35

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
You will need to purchase 11.0 gallons of paint 
to cover 3846.5 square feet.

STEPS TO WRITE THE CODE:
1. Define isinteger function – This function checks whether the input is a digit and ensures only numbers are accepted.  

2. Define choose_room function – Allows the user to select the room type (circle, rectangle, or L-shaped) and calls the appropriate function based on their input.  

3. Define circle function – Calculates the area of a circular ceiling using the formula pi × radius**2, then divides the result by 350 and rounds up to determine the gallons needed.  

4. Define rectangle function – Calculates the area by multiplying length × width, then determines the number of gallons required using rounding logic.  

5. Define Lshaped function – Splits an L-shaped room into two rectangles, calculates each area separately, sums them, and determines the total gallons needed.  

6. Ensure proper input validation – Convert inputs to integer before calculations to handle decimals correctly.    

7. Display the result – Print the total area covered and the number of gallons required for the selected room type.  

8. Run the program – Call choose_room() to start the process and allow user interaction.
