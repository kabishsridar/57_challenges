SAMPLE OUTPUT:
SubTotal: $112

Total: $118.16

STEPS TO WRITE THE CODE:
1. define a function isinteger to check whether it is a digit
2. prompt the user for number of items to be entered and store as n
3. initiate subtotal as 0 as we need to track the subtotal here
4. use for loop to iterate for n items to prompt user for price and quantity
5. if it is a digit, it should calculate the item_total, subtotal after converting them to integer
6. it should calculate the tax and total only after getting the last input so if loop == n- 1 is used
7. item_total will be the complete price of item
8. subtotal will be the total for all items
9. tax is 5.5%, so 0.055 is multiplied to get the tax amount of the items
10. add the tax amount to grand total and display the total
11. display the output
