STEPS TO WRITE THE CODE:
1. use for loop to iterate for 3 items to prompt user for price and quantity
2. initiate subtotal as 0 as we need to track the subtotal here
3. item_total will be the complete price of item
4. subtotal will be the total for all items
5. tax is 5.5%, so 0.055 is multiplied to get the tax amount of the items
6. add the tax amount to grand total and display the total
