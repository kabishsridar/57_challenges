SAMPLE INPUT:
Enter a number: 100
Enter a number: 200
Enter a number: 300
Enter a number: done

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
Numbers: 100, 200, 300
The average is 200.00
The minimum is 100
The maximum is 300
The standard deviation is 81.65

STEPS TO WRITE THE CODE:
1. import the math module
2. initiate array as an empty list
3. loop untill the user enters done to prompt the user for number
4. display the numbers enteres in a same line
5. to find average, create a function find_avg and use total/length for mean(average)
6. to find minimum and maximum, use min, max functions from math and name it as find_min_max function
7. to find standard deviation, use the function find_std_dev and calculate by finding varience and then the standard deviation
8. call the functions to execute
