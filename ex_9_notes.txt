SAMPLE INPUT:
Enter the length of ceiling(sq feet): 24
Enter the width of ceiling(sq feet): 15

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
You will need to purchase 2 gallons of paint 
to cover 360 square feet.

STEPS TO WRITE THE CODE:
1. prompt the user for length and width of the ceiling
2. calculate and store the area of the ceiling
3. initiate gallon as 350 because one gallon covers 350 sq feet
4. gallon required will be the area / gallon. we need only the whole number so we used area // gallon
5. we need complete gallon extra if we need gallon for more than 350 sq feet. so add 1
6. display the output
