SAMPLE INPUT:
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
10 + 5 = 15
10 - 5 = 5
10 * 5 = 50
10 / 5 = 2.0

SAMPLE INPUT 2:
Enter first number: h
Enter second number: s

SAMPLE OUTPUT2:
Only integers allowed.

SAMPLE INPUT 3:
Enter first number: -5
Enter second number: 15

SAMPLE OUTPUT 3:
Only integers allowed.

STEPS TO WRITE THE CODE:
1. define a function isinteger_positive to check if both inputs are positive integers and not other than numbers
2. use isdigit() function to verify it is digit
3. define a function operations to perform arithmetic operations(addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)
4. prompt user for integers and store it as num1 and num2 in string format to check isdigit function
5. check for DivisionByZeroError
6. if it is not an integer then it should display Only integers allowed
