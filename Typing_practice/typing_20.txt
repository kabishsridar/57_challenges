it was for $22.54, or  $416 adjusted for inflation. It was not until the 1980s that the average Social Security check for retirees exceeded $1000 a month adjusted for inflation. More than a quarter of Americans overa age 65 were classified by the Census Bureau as living in poverty until the late 1960s
There is a widespread belief along the lines of, "everyone used to have a private pension." But this is widely exaggerated. The Employee Benefits Research Institute explains: "Only a quarter of those age 65 or older had pension income in 1975. " Among that lucky minority, Only 15% of household income came from a pension.
The New York Times wrote in 1955 about the growing desire, but continued inability, to retire : "To rephrase an old saying : everyone talks about retirement, but apparently very few do anything about it.
It was not until the 1980s that the idea that everyone deserves, and should have, a dignified retirement took hold. And the way to get that dignified retirement ever since has been an expectation that everyone will save and invest their own money.
Let me reiterate how new this idea is : The 401 (k) -- the backbone savings vehicle of American retirement -- did not exists until 1978. The Roth IRA was not born until 198=98. If it were a person it would be barely old enough to drink.
It should surprise no one that many of us are bad at saving and investing for retirement. we're not crazy. We're all just newbies.
Same goes for college. the share of Americans over age 25 with a bachelor's degree has gone from less than 1 in 20 in 1940 to 1 in 4 by 2015. The average college tution over that time rose more than fourfold adjusted for inflation. Something
