we should emulate or avoid can be agonzingly hard.
Let me tell you another story of someone who, like Bill Gates, was wildly successful, but whose success is hard to pin down as being caused by luck or skill.
Cornelius VAnderbit had just finished a series of business deals to expand his railroad empire.
One of his business advisors leaned in to tell VAnderbit that every transaction he agreed to broke the law.
"My God, John, " Said Vanderbit, "You don't suppose you can run a railroad in accordance with the statues of the State of New York, do you? 
My first thought when reading this was: "That attitude is why he was so successful . So it's tempting to view his law- flaunting -- which was notorious and vital to his success -- as sage wisdom. That scrappy visionary let nothing get in his way!
But how dangerous is that analysis? No sane person would recommend flagrant crime as an entrepreneurial trait. You can easily imagine Vanderbit's story turning out much different -- an outflaw whose young company collapsed under court order.
So we have a problem here.
You can praise Vanderbit for flauntig the law with as much passion as you criticize Enron for doing the same. Perhaps one got lucky by avoiding the arm of the law while the other found itself on the side of risk.
John D. Rockefeller is similar. His frequent circumventing of the law -- a judge once called his company "no better than a common thief" -- is often portrayed by historians as cunning business smarts. Maybe it was. but when does the narrative shit from, "You didn't let outdated laws get in the way of innovation, " to "You commited a crime?" Or how little would the story have to shift for the narrative to have turned
