more than a trillion dollars.
A little quick math.
In 1968 there were roughly 303 million high - school - age people in the world, acording to the UN.
About 18 million of them lived in the United States.
About 270,000 of them lived in WAshington state.
A little over 100,000 of them lived in the Seattle area
And only about 303 million, end with 300.
One in a million high - school - age students attend the high school that had the combination of cash and foresight to buy a computer. Bill Gates happened to be one of them. 
Gates is not shy about what this meant. "If there had been no Lakeside, there would have been no Microsoft, "he told the school'd graduating class in 2005.
Gates is staggeringly smart, even more hardworking, and as a teenager had a vision for computers that even most seasoned computer executives couldn't grasp. He also had a one in a million head start by going to school at Lakeside.
Now let me tell you about Gate;s friend Kent Evans. He experienced an equally powerful dose of luck's close sibiling, risk. 
Bill Gates and Paul Allen became household names thanks to Microsoft's success. But back at Lakeside there was a third member of this gang of high - school computer prodogies.
Kent Evans and Bill Gates became best friends in eighth grade. Evans was, by Gate's own acount, the best student in the class.
They two talked "on the phone ridiculous amounts, " Gates recalls in the documentary Inside Bill's Brain. "I still know Kent's phone number , "he says. "525 - 7851."
Evans was as skilled with compputers as Gates and Allen. Lakeside once struggled to mannually put the school's class
