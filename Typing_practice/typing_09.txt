Most of the reason why, I believee is that we think about and are taught about money in ways that are too much like physics (with rules and laws) and not enough like psychology (with emotions and nuance)
And that, to me, is a fascinating as its important
Money is everywhere, it affects all of us, and confuses most of us. Everyine thinks about it a little differently. It offers lessons on things that apply to many areas of life, risk, confidence, and happiness. Few topics offer a more powerful magnifying glass that helps explain why people behave the way they do than money. It is one of the greatest shows on Earth.
My own appreciation for the psychology of money is shaped by more than a decade of writing on the topic. I began writing about finance in early 2008. It was the dawn of financial crisis and the worst recession in 80 years.
To write about what was happening, I wanted to figure out what was happening. But the first thing I learned after the financial crisis was that no one could accurately exaplain what happened, or why it happened, let alone what should be done about it. For every good explanation there was an equally convincing rebuttal.
Engineers can determine the cause of a bridge collapse because there's agreement that if a certain amount of force is applied to a certain area, that area will break. Physics isn't controversal. It's guided by laws. Finance is different. It's guided by people's behaviours
