For those who knew Ronald read, ther wasn't much else worth mentioning . his life was about as low key as they come.
Read fixed cars at a gas station for 25 years and swept floors at JCPenny for q7 years. he bought a two - bedroom house for 12000 at age 38 and lived there for the rest of his life.
he was windowed at age 50 and never reamarried. A friend recalled that this main hobby was chopping firewood.
