STEPS TO WRITE THE CODE:
1. import random module to guess the number by the system
2. define a function named difficulty level
3. set the range according to the question for each levels
4. define a function named play_game
5. use while loop and ask for difficulty level and proceed with choose_difficulty function for randint and assign it as num_computer
6. if it is None display an error message
7. initiate guess_count as 0 to track the number of guesses
8. use a while loop and prompt for the number from user and add 1 to guess_count
9. if the input from the user is not a number, display an error message
10. if guess in less than num_computer, display Too low
11. if guess is greater tha n num_computer, display Too high
12. else, display the number of guesses and you got it message and break
13. define a function loop and prompt the user whether to play again
14. if y, then loop it
15. else, Goodbye
16. run the function by __name__ == "__main__"
